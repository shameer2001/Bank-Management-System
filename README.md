# Bank-Management-System

This is a basic file-managment C++ program that allows you to store, edit, delete, view and create text files that hold bank records (althought this can be applied to any file-managment scenario).
It's a common C++ starter project that students can do. 
This program uses Classes, Conditionals and Logic, Inputs, Loops etc.
